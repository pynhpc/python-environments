# Python on HPC Clusters

## About the Tutorials

This tutorial series covers topics on using Python on HPC clusters. 
The specific steps are based on the HOPPER cluster at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA.
They should be implementable on most HPC clusters that have the [SLURM](https://www.schedmd.com/) scheduler installed, the [Environment Modules](https://modules.sourceforge.net/) system for managing packages and [Open onDemand](https://openondemand.org/) for a web-based GUI to access 
the cluster resources.
